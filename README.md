### Three positives
* Free
* Debugger for Chrome: It allows you to set breakpoints and debug JS from within VSCode
* Fast due to it's built on Node.js,Electron, HTML and CSS --> searching and no lags with 
opening and changing files. (Apparently on par with Sublime which is a paid editor)
* Options for customization
### Three negatives
* Embedded Git isn't powerful enough
  * _You can do nothing but to track changes, stage them and commit. No history, visualization, rebasing or cherry-picking â€“ these things are left to git console or external git client._
* Generalized
  * _VS Code is a general code/scripting IDE built to be lightweight and for people familiar with their language of choice, not directly comparable to Visual Studio in power or scope._
* Slow launch time
  * _Than it's competitors, e.g. Sublime Text._

>The main reason why I have chose this IDE is mainly due to the fact that it's a fast and 
lightweight editor with many extensions that you can implement. Moreover a big plus is that it has a debugging feature.
