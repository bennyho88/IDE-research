### Search for different IDE's online

	 1. __Visual Studio Code__
	 2. __Atom__
	 3. __Brackets__
	 4. __Notepad++c__
	 6. __Vim__
	 7. __Komodo Edit__

### A download link of the IDE
	 * [Download link]: https://code.visualstudio.com/Download

### Three positives
	 * Free
	 * Debugger for Chrome: It allows you to set breakpoints and debug JS from within VSCode
	 * Fast due to it's built on Node.js,Electron, HTML and CSS --> searching and no lags with 
	   opening and changing files. (Apparently on par with Sublime which is a paid editor)
	 * Options for customization
### Three negatives
	 * Embedded Git isn't powerful enough
	   > You can do nothing but to track changes, stage them and commit. No history, visualization, rebasing or cherry-picking â€“ these 		     things are left to git console or           external git client.
	 *Generalized
	   >VS Code is a general code/scripting IDE built to be lightweight and for people familiar with their language of choice, not 	     directly comparable to Visual Studio in power or scope.
	 *Slow launch time
	   > Than it's competitors, e.g. Sublime Text.

### No.1 Reason why you chose this IDE

	The main reason why I have chose this IDE is mainly due to the fact that it's a fast and 
	lightweight editor with many extensions that you can implement. Moreover a big plus is that it has a debugging feature.
