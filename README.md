	1. Visual Studio Code

        A download link of the IDE
	- https://code.visualstudio.com/Download
        Three positives
	- Free
	- Debugger for Chrome: It allows you to set breakpoints and debug JS from within VSCode
	- Fast due to it's built on Node.js,Electron, HTML and CSS --> searching and no lags with 
	  opening and changing files. (Apparently on par with Sublime which is a paid editor)
	- Options for customization
        Three negatives
	- Embedded Git isn't powerful enough
	You can do nothing but to track changes, stage them and commit. No history, visualization, 		rebasing or che rry-picking â€“ these things are left to git console or external git client.
	- Generalized
	VS Code is a general code/scripting IDE built to be lightweight and for people familiar 	with their language of choice, not directly comparable to Visual Studio in power or scope.
	- Slow launch time
	Than it's competitors, e.g. Sublime Text.

        No.1 Reason why you chose this IDE

	The main reason why I have chose this IDE is mainly due to the fact that it's a fast and 
	lightweight editor with many extensions that you can implement. Moreover a big plus is 		that it has a debugging feature.
