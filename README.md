### Search for different IDE's online

	 1. Visual Studio Code
	 2. Atom
	 3. Brackets
	 4. Notepad++
	 5. TextMate
	 6. Vim
	 7. Komodo Edit

### A download link of the IDE
	 * https://code.visualstudio.com/Download

### Three positives
	 * Free
	 * Debugger for Chrome: It allows you to set breakpoints and debug JS from within VSCode
	 * Fast due to it's built on Node.js,Electron, HTML and CSS --> searching and no lags with 
	   opening and changing files. (Apparently on par with Sublime which is a paid editor)
	 * Options for customization
### Three negatives
	 * Embedded Git isn't powerful enough
	   __You can do nothing but to track changes, stage them and commit. No history, visualization, rebasing or cherry-picking – these 		     things are left to git console or           external git client.__
	 *Generalized
	   __VS Code is a general code/scripting IDE built to be lightweight and for people familiar with their language of choice, not 	     directly comparable to Visual Studio in power or scope.__
	 *Slow launch time
	   __Than it's competitors, e.g. Sublime Text.__

### No.1 Reason why you chose this IDE

	The main reason why I have chose this IDE is mainly due to the fact that it's a fast and 
	lightweight editor with many extensions that you can implement. Moreover a big plus is that it has a debugging feature.
